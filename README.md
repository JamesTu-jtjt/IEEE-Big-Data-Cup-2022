# IEEE Big Data Cup 2022 - Trip Destination Prediction
This repository contains the source code and methodology used by our team to participate in the IEEE Big Data Cup 2022, focusing on Trip Destination Prediction. We are proud to announce that we achieved 2nd place on the global leaderboard and presented our findings at the IEEE Conference on Big Data.
### Team Name: NCKU H.D.D.J. [Challenge Leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ieee-bigdata-cup-2022-destination-prediction/leaderboard)

## Overview

In this competition, we were tasked with predicting trip destinations based on various data sources, including user profiles, historical trip data, and other contextual information. 

## Methodology

For a detailed explanation of our methodology, please refer to our paper titled "[An Embarrassingly Simple Rule-based Visiting Circulation Approach to Trip Destination Prediction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10020650)" published in the proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Big Data. The paper outlines our approach, data preprocessing steps, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation metrics.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to express our gratitude to the organizers of the IEEE Big Data Cup 2022 for providing an exciting and challenging competition.
